# PlannerProject

## By: Kori Huen & Benjamin Huang
An application that allows the user to input their schedule, write notes, and save their data. The application will 
function similar to the already existing applications called Notion and Evernote. The user will be able to write notes
on the application, read these notes, save these notes, and load previously written notes. The user will also be able 
to create a schedule with the application which can be synced with Google calendar so that their schedule is visible 
on both applications. 

This application will be applicable to students, professionals, and any person who takes notes or uses a schedule of
some sort.
